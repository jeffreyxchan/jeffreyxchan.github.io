            <h2>Why do some people call you BJ?</h2>
            <p>It's my nickname.</p>
            <p>I used to play badminton with my friend Jeffrey Chen and our coach needed a way to differentiate us since we have the same name. Our coach was going to call us Jeffrey 1 and Jeffrey 2 until our friend Stephen pointed at me and said:</p>
            <p style='text-align: center;'><i>"Why don't we call this one Big Jeffrey or BJ for short?"</i></p>
            <p>The rest is history.</p>

        <div class='question'>
            <h2>What type of music do you listen too?</h2>
            <p>I really like listening to anything with a really fast beat or strong bass. It pushes me to think and code faster.</p>
            <p>When doing homework or just messing around on my computer, I usually put on an EDM station on Pandora and I'm good to go. I also listen to some J-Pop or C-Pop depending on Earth's position relative to the sun.</p>

            <h2>Do you have a favorite quote?</h2>
            <p style='text-align: center;'>"Wait, I get paid to make jokes. Just look at my code!"</p>

        <div class='question'>
            <h2>Do you even lift, bro?</h2>
            <p>I used to but not anymore. My currrent goal is to lose weight so I'm focusing more on cardio and dieting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='question'>
            <h2>What do you find yourself super passionate about?</h2>
            <p><i>I really really like building cool stuff.</i></p>
            <p>You're probably thinking "that's sooo clich&eacute;" but I can't spin it any other way. I often catch myself losing track of time because I'm immersed in personal projects or online tutorials to expand my skillset. The pain and frustration that comes with developing is always rewarded with an amazing sense of accomplishment. And I love receiving feedback and compliments from my peers when I try to show them how cool my projects are.</p>
            <p>I'm still uncertain how long I will continue building and developing, but I'm having an absolute blast doing it right now!</p>

            <h2>What do you get in your Chipotle bowl?</h2>
            <p>Brown rice, black beans, fajitas, barbacoa, "medium" salsa, extra corn, sour cream, cheese, guac, lettuce.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='question'>
            <h2>Do you mix your Chipotle before you enjoy it?</h2>
            <p>No</p>
            <p>It's sort of like enjoying a sandwich - I like having the different flavors and textures meet my mouth/tongue in a certain order. I specifically like how the combination of cheese, corn, and sour cream feels on the top of my mouth. See above question for the specific order.</p>

            <p>Vi</p>
            <p>Defeating your opponents with only your fists feels amazing.</p>

            <h2>How do you pronounce GIF?</h2>
            <p>The following is probably the funniest and most compelling argument I've ever encountered:</p>
            <div id='gif-wrapper'>
                <img id='gift-gif' src='../images/gift-gif.gif' alt='Say gift without the t' />
            </div> <br />
            <p>I also pronounce JPEG as "jay-peg"</p>

            <h2>When you're at home, do you pee standing up or sitting down?</h2>
            <p>I sit.</p>
            <p>You have 100% accuracy when you're sitting down, which is pretty great for when you have to pee in the middle of the night.</p>

        <div class='question'>
            <h2>What would be your ideal first date?</h2>
            <p>Dinner. Has to be KBBQ. Afterwards, we can burn off the meal by hiking up the mountain to Griffith Observatory and look over the LA city lights.</p>
