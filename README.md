# My Profile

Type in <a href="jeffreyxchan.github.io">jeffreyxchan.github.io</a> in your address bar (or click the link) to view my personal website/profile! There you can find more information about me, my projects, and my skills.
It still needs a lot of work, and I can't promise you that I'll update it frequently,
but as always, I will try my best!
<br><br>
If you have any comments or suggestions as to how to style my website, how to make it
more responsive, or some content that's crucial to include in a profile/portfolio,
feel free to let me know.
<br><br>
Cheers!
