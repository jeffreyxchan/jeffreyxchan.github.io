Overcooked 2 is an AMAZING multiplayer party game to have on your switch (it's digital only). In the game, you take on the role of a chef in a kitchen that has to prepare and deliver a set of dishes under a certain amount of time to pass the level. The most consistently you're able to deliver overs on time, the higher the score you receive for each dish, and the higher the chance of you receiving the almighty 3 star rating at the end of the level. But if you take too long, you risk dropping orders and harming your score.<span id="dots">...</span>

The game can be played with 1-4 players at a time, getting a little more chaotic the more chefs you have in the kitchen. You'll have to skillfully balance the challenging mechanics between each player in order to keep the kitchen efficiently running, which can cause a bit of chaotic shouting among players as they bump into each other or fail to deliver and ingredient in time.

The game features around many different "worlds" that are part of a map, and there are about 6 levels per world. I'm very satisfied with the level designs. Progressing through the levels gives you new recipes to cook which have more demanding preparation instructions. The layout of the kitchen changes which add to the difficulty of finding your way around and optimizing your routine. The combination of these designs keep the game interesting and challenging enough so that you don't get bored of it and think about when the next time you'll be able get back into the kitchen. It can be a tiring game though (from all the shouting) and it's pretty easy to put down and pick up again. The controls are super simple and each player can play with a single Joycon just fine.

If you're looking for a 4 player game to scream and shout with your friends over, I would say Overcooked 2 is a must have.
