I dropped this game within the first two hours of playing it. Some people loved it, but it's just not my game.<span id="dots">...</span>

The characters aren't charming to me. I've never encountered the Rabbids until this game, and while they did give me a small chuckle now and then, they overall weren't attractive to me. The Mario characters are just Mario sprites put in a different setting. It didn't really draw me in. The cast of characters and their super minimal interactions with each other bored me.

From this game, I learned that I'm just not into this sort of combat system. You have to take advantage of the geography of the map as well as the positioning of your characters and the enemies. I can definitely see how this combat system would need a good amount of strategy and thinking in order to be successful, which is just fine. I'm just unsatisfied with how slow everything went. Like having to wait for all the animations, and then waiting for the enemy to complete their turn, was too painful for me. They even have an option to speed up the enemies turn, but that still didn't feel fast enough for me. I guess I just wanted it to end faster. I've seen a couple of JRPG's use a similar combat system, which is making me question whether I should give those a try, or just stay away completely because I already know I might not like them.

Overall advice: This game can be very good (not too sure about the price). Just do your research and know what type of game it is before making this purchase. I'm just glad I was able to get it on sale.
