Katana ZERO is a 2D action RPG that features an interesting combat mechanic: each enemy only takes one hit to kill, but so do you. The game is split up into levels where you clear levels by defeating every enemy in the area or completing some other related task. When this game was announced and released, there seemed to be a lot of hype around it (or maybe that was just me getting sucked into marketing) and I bought it off that.

The main combat gameplay was pretty fun. It was pretty fun to try and clear maps with your abilities to jump and dash around. Being able to fly around the map killing enemies is pretty cool.

The story was hard to make out. It's one of those games where the game doesn't tell you what's going on - you just have to figure it out from the clues that are thrown around between the characters in vague dialogue, or other interactions in the game. The story is DARK. This is not a slice of life game with a mellow theme and mood. This game has a lot of gore and death in it, and even touches upon psychological issues, which is the complete opposite of sunshine and rainbows. I felt there could've been more to the story. It's a pretty short game, and the game ended on a cliffhanger. I felt like the game had so much more potential to expand on the short gameplay we were given, but I guess this is just what you get for a low price point.

Nah, I wouldn't recommend this game. It has a low price, looks well developed, and the 1-hit combat was pretty enjoyable. I just think there coulda been so much more to the game had they decided to write out the plot more, or introduce more combat mechanics to the game to keep it new.
