1-2-Switch is considered a tech demo for the Nintendo Switch. It's like Wii Sports or Wii Play for the Wii - a compilation of mini-games meant to show off the capabilities of a new console. In 1-2-Switch, you start off with 4-5 mini-games and as you play, you unlock up to a total of 28 games. Each game is designed to utilize some feature of the Nintendo Switch and can be played with the Joycons that came with the Switch with 1-2 players.<span id="dots">...</span>

The games are fun and can be replayed a bunch of times, but they aren't exactly games that keep you coming back. You invite some friends over just so they could play some of the games on 1-2-Switch. There are probably other games you'd rather play, and after playing the mini-games a couple times, you'll probably be like "Ok I get it, let's move on" and not come back to it again. It's full retail price of $60 also prevented me from giving it a higher rating. Developing and producing 28 games must've been expensive, but the value I got out of it as a player was worth more like $30 or less. Wouldn't recommend purchasing this game to play, unless you already know you'll enjoy the mini-games a lot.
