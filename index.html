        <h2>Summer 2016 Updates Completed</h2>
        <p>After long hours of coding, the layout and contents of this website have finally been brought to a presentable and finalized state. The old design was completed scrapped and redesigned. The other pages are up-to-date with their respectivce content. Please feel free to look around and email me if you find any bugs with the design.</p>

        <h2>Mass Update 7/10/16</h2>
        <p>Hi, Jeffrey here. As you can see, the last update I made to this website was about 6 months ago. Since then, I've had a lot of fun working on other development projects with my friends at Daily Bruin, Creative Labs, and UCLA IEEE. It's probably time that I start giving my personal website some love and applying some new skills that I've learned in these last few months. Over the summer, I'll be making huge efforts into reformatting this page.</p>

        <h2>Foundation has Arrived! 1/29/16</h2>
        <p>After going through some training, I learned how to use Foundation - the cool library of functions that I'm hoping will make my web projects look much better. After learning some of the basics, I decided to revamp the formatting of my website with Foundation. I'm very excited because for the first time, this page should be mobile-friendly. Hope it's looking as nice to you as it is to me! Have a good one.</p>

        <h2>Content Addition and Formatting Changes 1/7/16</h2>
        <p>The "About Me" and "Projects" pages now have more content to them instead of being blank.</p>
        <p>All pages have undergone some significant formatting changes (or at least as significant as I can make it). Looks nice to me. If you're reading this, HAPPY NEW YEAR!</p>

        <h2>Website Description</h2>
        <p>Hi there. Feel free to look around and browse around my website. This website still needs a heavy amount of work. I hope to build it into something presentable sometime before I die. Until then, I hope you have a nice day!</p>
