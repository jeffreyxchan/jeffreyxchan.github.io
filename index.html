                <h2>Foundation has Arrived! 1/29/16</h2>
                <p>After going through some training, I learned how to use Foundation - the cool library of functions that I'm hoping will make my web projects look much better. After learning some of the basics, I decided to revamp the formatting of my website with Foundation. I'm very excited because for the first time, this page should be mobile-friendly. Hope it's looking as nice to you as it is to me! Have a good one.</p>
                <h2>Content Addition and Formatting Changes 1/7/16</h2>
                <p>The "About Me" and "Projects" pages now have more content to them instead of being blank.</p>
                <p>All pages have undergone some significant formatting changes (or at least as significant as I can make it). Looks nice to me. If you're reading this, HAPPY NEW YEAR!</p>
                <h2>Wanna try clicking this button? 12/9/15</h2>
                <button type="button" class="button">CLICK THIS BUTTON</button>
                    <p>Cool huh? I was so excited about learning how to put a button on my website that I just slapped one onto the page without worrying about its functionality. If you're bored and would rather spam that button than do work, be my guest.</p>
                <h2>Added Navigation Bar 12/9/15</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I added the navigation bar at the top of my page and it actually works. Check it out!

                <h2>Website Description</h2>
                <p>
            Hi there. Feel free to look around and browse around my website. This website still needs a heavy amount of work. I hope to build it into something presentable sometime before I die. Until then, I hope you have a nice day!
