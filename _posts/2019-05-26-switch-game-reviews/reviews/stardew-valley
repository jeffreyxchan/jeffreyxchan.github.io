Stardew Valley is what's known as a "farming simulator". In the game, you take on the role of someone who inherits a piece of farmland. You spend the rest of the game exploring and performing numerous activities, such as growing and selling crops, creating relationships with the people in down, mining for materials in the mines, and much much more.<span id="dots">...</span>

I came into this game completely blind. I had only heard of its name and that it had many positive reviews, so I bought it without any research. I guess you could say I was suprised... I did not expect to come into this game and literally just do nothing but... farm. Like IT'S JUST SO MUCH FARMING. I clocked in a good number of hours into this game (enough to get through the first year) but I didn't find it the most addicting game and put it down afterwards. But in the hours I spent, I definitely had fun playing. I've actually spent around 10 hours in it, which is more than I've had to give to some other games, so I think I was pretty sucked into it for a bit. The game is very relaxed, slow, and calming. It's a great game for anyone trying to shut their brain for the day and play a slow and peaceful game.

It has many great reviews, and is apparently accepted as best enjoyed on the Switch (Stardew is a port from a PC). It's also super cheap! So if this sorta game sounds like something you'd enjoy, I'd highly recommend giving it a try. It's just not my cup of tea.
