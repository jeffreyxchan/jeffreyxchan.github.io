TL;DR: It's a great looking action RPG that features first person combat, an extensive campaign system, and the ability to team up with other players in the community. It's just not the game for me right now.<span id="dots">...</span>

Warframe is a pretty graphically intensive game that got ported over to the Switch through the amazing effort of the Panic Button team. Although probably not as crisp as it is on beefier platforms, it still looks great and runs super smoothly, redefining what is possible for the Switch.

The game isn't too beginner friendly, and my brother seems to agree with me on this. They sorta just throw you into this huge world and you get overwhelmed with everything you could do. I just wanted someone to explain to me what the heck was going on as I played for the first time. I'm sure this game is amazing, it's just not the game for me. Luckily it's FREE which is amazing. I've heard the Warframe community is also super welcoming and helpful, so reaching out to them would also be helpful.

Check out the reviews made by Wulff Den and BeatEmUps. They love the game and can possibly get you excited about playing it. Despite all the complaints I had about it, I genuinely think it could be a super fun game that you could sink your life into.
