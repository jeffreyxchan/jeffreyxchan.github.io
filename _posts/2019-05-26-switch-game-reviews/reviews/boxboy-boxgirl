I bought this because I had seen its promotion on the cover of the e-Shop so many times leading up to it's release, and it seemed like a nice puzzle game. At only $10 for so many puzzles, I made the purchase not too long after it came out.<span id="dots">...</span>

In single player mode, you basically use your abilities to get from one end of a level to the other. You get scored based on how many boxes you had to use in order to reach the goal. The game also features two player mode, where you can play as both BOXBOY and BOXGIRL and solve some puzzles that require two players to be present. The Switch promotes itself as a console always ready for multiplayer, and I'm happy to see that this game prepared for that as well. A friend can always jump in and start solving puzzles with you.

I wish the puzzles were a little bit harder though. It's super easy to actually get from one end of a puzzle to the other. It gets a little more challenging when you try to minimize your usage of blocks to get the three star score, but they weren't super difficult. I could go through multiple levels and score three stars on the first try, although I will admit some levels made really have to look at the puzzle a different way to get the full score.

I'm haven't finished playing this game. There's just so much more content to go and so many mechanics and plot points that I have yet to discover. I think this game is an excellent choice if you're looking to sit back, relax, and solve a couple of cute looking puzzles in you free time. I would find myself rushing back to my desk multiple times looking to make more progress on solving all these puzzles, and looking forward to doing it again!
