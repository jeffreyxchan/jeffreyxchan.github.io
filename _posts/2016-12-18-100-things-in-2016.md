Tried my best to record all the moments and achievements in 2016 that made me happy. It's hard to do
100 special things during the year. It's equivalent to doing 2 special things every week, but some weeks
for me just consisted of grinding through responsibilities and going through school work. Hopefully next year
I can finally break the big 100.

1. Formed a General Board team with Robert-senpai, Allison, Jiwan, and Michael! **#Team Mango**
