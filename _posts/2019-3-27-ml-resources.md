This past quarter I took UCLA's CSM146 - Introduction to Machine Learning, taught
by Professor Sriram Sankararaman. Aside from the materials used in class,
I found a couple of online resources helpful when studying some intro ML
concepts and wanted to share them here.

This will probably just be a general list of all ML resources I find useful.

## Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
[Super cool Stack Exchange post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues)

## Gaussian Mixture Models and the Expectation Maximization Algorithm

## Viterbi Algorithm (Hidden Markov Models)
