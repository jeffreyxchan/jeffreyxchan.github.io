Club activities.

Those were basically what ate up most of my time during this first week back to school.
Luckily there wasn't too much going on academically because most of my assignments
weren't due until at least a week later.

The biggest club event this week was our General Meeting 1, where we would be going over some
of the various programs that we have set up for the year, and talk about the various projects
and opportunities that our members can take advantage of. It's considered one of our most
important events because it's the meeting that leaves the biggest impression on our new and
returning members. If we wanted to grow stronger as a club, we had to make this meeting a huge
success.

On Tuesday, we did a run-through of our presentation, making sure that everyone was on the same
page in terms of the flow of the meeting. When it came time for the real thing, I felt we were
well prepared. I felt a huge relief after we had concluded our meeting and released everyone
to graze on our collection of Subway sandwiches. It was a meeting we had been preparing for
since the Summer, and I felt it was a huge success. Here's a picture of our officer board
after the meeting:

Afterwards, the week was filled with other meetings and pressure to finish my math homework.
There were infosessions for our IEEE projects for the year and a Daily Bruin Online section meeting
(that I missed because it conflicted with GM1). I also went to an orientation for students
accepted into UPE. Definitely looking forward to inducting into the chapter at the end of the quarter,
but the mandatory tutoring hours give me a mixed feeling.

What capped off a pretty long week was Natalie's birthday on Friday. Here's a picture of the birthday
girl:

We took an Uber to this ramen place within a Japanese super market. Despite how small the place was, the ramen
was definitely on point. Unfortunately the market closed early at 8:30 PM, so we took and Uber back
to UCLA and met in my room. From there, the real party began as we had a very heated board game night.
My friend Kelly taught us a new card game called Nerts. It was basically solitaire performed in teams of
two and it was super fun. Definitely hoping that our great friend group will always be able to meet up
some time and have nights like these.

Before I concluded this post, I think it's worth mentioning that I also went to auditions for Foundations,
one of the several dance groups withing UCLA's dance community. The audition piece wasn't that hard, but
auditioning in front of other members of Foundation was difficult and I probably forgot about 50% of the
choreography. Regardless, I had fun and I'm excited to see what the rest of the quarter with Foundations
will be like!
